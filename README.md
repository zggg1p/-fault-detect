This project is to classify the state of the welding chip. Considering the complexity of the problem, only two classifications are carried out, namely normal and abnormal.  
Through the test of fully connected network, convolutional neural network and Fine-tuning Of Google Net, we found that fine-tuning of Google Net had the best effect, reaching the highest score of 70 out of a full score of 80.
